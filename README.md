# ThermalView

CodeLite & VS 2013 solutions.

You will need <strong>at least</strong>:
<ul>
  <li>c++11
  <li>wxWidgets 3
  <li>boost 1.54 *
  <li>libusb-1.0
</ul>

Note: Should work with boost 1.54, but I switched to 1.58 to get rid of some of the warnings that get generated when compiling with g++.
